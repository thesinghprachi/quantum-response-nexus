- **Real-time Database** - Maintains system state with automatic synchronization

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Token-based authentication with short-lived access tokens
- Row-level security for database access
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Scaling Capabilities

The platform is designed to handle:
- Thousands of concurrent users
- Multiple simultaneous disaster events
- Terabytes of sensor and satellite data
- Real-time processing of field reports and updates

## Development Workflow

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Automated testing suite
- Feature flagging for phased rollouts
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
